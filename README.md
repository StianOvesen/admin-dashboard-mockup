# admin-dashboard-mockup

**A demo of the mockup can be seen [here.](http://www.stianovesen.com/admin-dashboard-mockup/)**

This is a simple mockup of a dashboard. The goal of the mockup was to create a responsive grid system for project cards.

The wireframe was provided by The Odin Project, with a png as reference. The implementation is done with vanilla HTML and CSS.
